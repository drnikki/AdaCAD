# Notes while developing pedals interface for AdaCAD

Author(s): S

Any directory paths assume that `/` is the root of the local AdaCAD repository.

Timing on pedal driver program: the upstream pedals are not being read in, seems to be one clock cycle off, comes in after the last clock cycle after the read period.

## Architecture of Operations
Mentally mapping, operations are actions (functions) that can take input drafts (0, 1, or N) and create output drafts (1 or N). The Operation class should really just be a wrapper for the perform() function.

perform: (input_drafts: Array<Draft> | Draft | null, params?: Array<OpParams>) => output_drafts: Array<Draft> | Draft;

If operation A outputs a draft that gets inputted into operation B, then operation B is 'downstream' or a 'child' operation of operation A / A is 'upstream' or a 'parent' of B. You can also say that A and B are in 'series' or in 'sequence'.

Operations are in 'parallel' if they share one or more (a set) of input drafts.

An operation can also have inputs which are not drafts: parameters, which affect how they generate output drafts. These are equivalent to extra arguments in the perform() function.

Operations and I/O drafts are organized as nodes of a Tree.

Two operations in series (A is parent to B) should function like B.perform(A.perform(A.input_drafts))

This line of code should be possible: ResultDrafts = StartingDrafts.opA(paramsA).opB(paramsB)

## Service to Component
1. We will take an Angular Service, which creates and updates a data structure that represents some external input (e.g. ML model, database entries), and create a Component for AdaCAD where a user can interact with and edit it.
2.

Adding DraftPlayer into a new `Player` component underneath `mixer`.
Icon refs: https://fontawesome.com/search?q=play&m=free&s=solid%2Cregular%2Cbrands (which I used for the "play" button icon);

## Routing Draft from SubDraft Component to Player  

1. Added "play" button in `[FILE] subdraft.component.html`
2. Added event emitter `onDraftToPlayer` in `[FILE] subdraft.component.ts`
3. Added function `sendDraftToPlayer()` that is called on `(click)`. Tells event emitter to emit the draft of the subdraft component (`this._draft: Draft`)
4. The `palette` component is the parent component of the subdraft, so it receives the event. Added an event emitter also called `onDraftToPlayer` in `[FILE] palette.component.ts` that passes on the `Draft` object.
5. Added method to handle the event, `this.subdraftToPlayer()`
6. Added subscription to this event in `setSubdraftSubscriptions` method in `[FILE] palette.component.ts`
7. The `mixer` component is the parent of `palette`. Added a new property `playerSubscription` to `[FILE] mixer.component.ts` with type `Subscription`.
8. Added method `this.draftToPlayer()` to handle the palette event, setting the active draft of `player` to the draft that has been passed up from the subdraft component. The method also tells `player` to draw the draft.
9. Added line in `ngAfterViewInit()` that assigns the subscription for the palette event to the handler method.

Workflow for AdaCAD ML
1. Locally trained the model, saved model weights (output of training) to JSON -- still not in AdaCAD repo
2. add JSON to AdaCAD assets folder in repo
3. Service that uses model weights to predict
    - generates draft for VAE (style transfer)
    - classifier returns number
4. Putting on interface? Laura did it

## Rules of thumb for modifying code
- **Components** are responsible for rendering *views* into the design. They should NOT do any computation on the design data.
- **Services** do the actual data manipulation and are placed in folders named `provider`
    - `/core/provider`: Everything that interfaces with Firebase lives here. Generally, a new interaction with Firebase should mean a new service.
    - `/mixer/provider`: 
- Use Angular's built-in file generator commands! (link?)
- New datatypes are implemented as **interfaces**. (why?)

## INSTALLATION
### LIST A:
1. Make new branch on AdaCAD repo
2. Pull branch from remote to local directory (`/` = `AdaCAD-weaver/` on my drive)
3. Open terminal in local directory
4. Run `npm install` (may take a while)

### LIST B, CONCURRENT:
1. Get `environment.ts` file from a lab member (has Firebase config stuff)
2. Drop `environment.ts` into `/src/environments`, replacing existing file if need be

### Once Lists A and B are both complete:
1. Run `ng serve` in the terminal to serve AdaCAD locally. Should update with any changes in the code from here.
2. Pull any changes from remote regularly.
